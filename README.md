This repository contains the design for a printable adapter to mount the Thule Chariot CX to a Montague bicycle. The mount features a 3D-printed washer that fits onto the rear axis nut. An M3 screw is used to connect through Montague's hollow rear axis shaft.

## Issue resolving 3D printable models

In addition to the main adapter design, this repository also includes several other models for repairs of common issues encountered with the Thule Chariot CX. These models are intended to help with troubleshooting and fixing frequently encountered failures.

### Replacement Handlebar button pins

The [Chariot CX handlebar](https://www.thule.com/-/s/approved/std.lang.all/12/44/371244.pdf) originally has zinc coated steel button pins to fix the handlebar in the stroller frame.  This design results in increased wear of aluminium frame tubes which ends by extending hole allowing the escape of metal pin from the handlebar. 

The model [chariot_handlebar_pin.stl](https://github.com/kaklik/Chariot-Hitch-Arm-mount/blob/master/CAD/chariot_handlebar_pin.stl) replaces the original metal buttons by 3D printable plastic models. This replacement significantly reduces the additional wear of the aluminium tubing and the same time fixes the escaping ping trought the worn out hole.
